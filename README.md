Linear Regression Assignment

Here’s a description of each step for analyzing the data:

Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data
In this step, we load the dataset into the workspace using appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas) and examine its structure. Key actions include:

Checking the first few rows using head() to understand the data format.
Identifying data types and missing values using info() and isnull().sum().
Summarizing the data with descriptive statistics (describe()) to understand central tendencies and variability.
Step 2: Visualising the Data
We use data visualization techniques to explore relationships and identify patterns in the dataset. This includes:

Plotting distributions of numerical features using histograms or density plots.
Visualizing relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots for continuous variables, bar plots for categorical variables).
Exploring correlations using a heatmap.
This step helps in detecting outliers, understanding distributions, and selecting important features.

Step 3: Data Preparation
Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming the data for modeling. This includes:

Handling missing values by imputation or removal.
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaling numerical features using normalization or standardization for algorithms sensitive to magnitude.
Creating new features if necessary (e.g., polynomial terms or interactions).
Step 4: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
The dataset is split into two parts:

Training Set: Used to train the model.
Testing Set: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. We typically use an 80:20 or 70:30 split ratio. This ensures the model is tested on data it hasn't seen during training.
Step 5: Building a Linear Model
This step involves:

Selecting independent variables (X) and the target variable (y).
Building a linear regression model using libraries like sklearn.
Using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features.
Iteratively refining the model by dropping features with high p-values or low significance.
Step 6: Residual Analysis of the Train Data and Validation
Residual analysis is performed to validate model assumptions and identify potential issues. Key actions include:

Plotting residuals vs. fitted values to check for randomness (no patterns indicate a good fit).
Checking for normality of residuals using histograms or Q-Q plots.
Verifying that residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).
These checks ensure the model adheres to the assumptions of linear regression.

Step 7: Making Predictions Using the Final Model
The final model, refined based on training data, is used to make predictions on:

Training Data: To check how well the model fits the known data.
Testing Data: To evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Predictions are compared against actual values to compute errors and assess the model’s reliability.

Step 8: Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared errors.
R-squared (R²): Proportion of variance explained by the model.
Adjusted R²: Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.
Additional steps may include analyzing overfitting or underfitting and comparing the model with alternative approaches.

By following these structured steps, we ensure a thorough analysis and reliable results from the data modeling process.
